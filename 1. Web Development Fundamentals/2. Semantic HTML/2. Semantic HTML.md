## NOTE:
- For verifying sematic html, performance, accessibilty and SEO, we have some tools like - `Lighthouse` on chrome dev tool, `W3C`, `Wave` etc.
- `<meta name="description" content="...">` The `description` meta tag provides a brief summary of the webpage content. Search engines like Google often use the content of this tag as the snippet shown in search results, right below the page title. When someone shares your link on platforms like Facebook, Twitter, or LinkedIn, this description might appear in the preview, making your link more engaging.
