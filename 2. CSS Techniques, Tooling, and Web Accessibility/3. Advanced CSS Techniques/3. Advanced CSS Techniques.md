CSS varibales can be local or global scoped. If we want to declare the variables within global scope, then we will declare the variable within `root` pseudoclass. If the varibale is local variable then, it will only be accessed within the elements with that class or any of its children element.

## Scroll Snap
Sometimes, you’ll want to control where users land as they scroll through your content. Scroll snap is a CSS tool that helps guide user focus by defining where their scrolling stops, creating a smoother and more intentional experience.

## Parallax Effect
The parallax effect creates the visual illusion of layers moving at different speeds. In frontend design, this is typically implemented by making a background element appear layered beneath a foreground element, with the background shifting as the user scrolls. This gives a modern and engaging design.
