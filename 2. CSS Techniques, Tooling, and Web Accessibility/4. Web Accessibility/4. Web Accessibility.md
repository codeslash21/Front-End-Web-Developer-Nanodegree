## Web Accessibility
One of the first steps to making your application more accessible is using Semantic HTML. Semantic HTML helps describe the structure and purpose of a webpage to assistive tools like screen readers. Tags like `<div>` and `<span>` are generic and don’t provide much information about an element's purpose. In contrast, semantic tags like headings (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, etc.) help identify specific sections of a page, making it easier to navigate.

### Examples of Semantic Tags:
- `<main>`: Identifies the main content of the page.
- `<nav>`: Used for navigation menus.
- `<aside>`: Represents supporting information, such as sidebars or advertisements.
- `<footer>`: Indicates the end of the page and may contain content like sitemaps, contact information, or copyright notices.

### ARIA Attributes
ARIA(Accessibility Reach Internet Application) attributes are another way to help identify the purpose of different HTML elements. Modern applications often rely on a combination of ARIA attributes and Semantic HTML, or sometimes Semantic HTML alone.

#### ARIA Attributes includes:
- **Roles:** `role` attribute is used to define the purpose of an element, such as `button` or `menu`.
- **Properties:** Describe characteristics of an element, like `aria-label` or `aria-hidden`.
- **States:** Describe dynamic properties of an element that can change, such as `aria-expanded` or `aria-checked`.
