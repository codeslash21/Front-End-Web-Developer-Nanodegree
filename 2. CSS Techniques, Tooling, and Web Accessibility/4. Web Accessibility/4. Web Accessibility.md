# Web Accessibility
One of the first steps to making your application more accessible is using Semantic HTML. Semantic HTML helps describe the structure and purpose of a webpage to assistive tools like screen readers. Tags like <div> and <span> are generic and donâ€™t provide much information about an element's purpose. In contrast, semantic tags like headings (<h1>, <h2>, etc.) help identify specific sections of a page, making it easier to navigate.
