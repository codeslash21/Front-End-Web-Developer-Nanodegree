# HTML

- HTML tags help tell the browser how to render different elements on the page
- `<!DOCTYPE html>` - to tell the browser that this doc has html code or the browser should render this document according to HTML 5 specification.
- Semantic html element has some meaning or purpose attached to it.
- HTML has some special entity like &copy;
- All HTML elements can have attributes. Attributes provide additional information about an element, and are always specified in the start tag. Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like `name="value"`. For example `id` is an attribute which allows us to programatically select an element.
