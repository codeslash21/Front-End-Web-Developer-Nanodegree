## HTML Elements
- **Headings:** Headings are used to indicate titles on your page or the beginning of a section. There are six levels of headings, from `<h1>` (most important) to `<h6>` (least important). The main title of your page should always be an `<h1>`, and it should be the only `<h1>` on a page. Also, its not mandatory that `<h1>` will always have biggest font size.
- **List:** The `<li>` tags must always be placed within an ordered or unordered list.
- **Link:** Link is created using the `<a>` tag, which stands for "anchor." We can use `target="_blank"` to open the link in new tab. `<a href="https://www.udacity.com" target="_blank">Visit Udacity</a>`.
- **Div:** `<div>` which stands for division. This element has no functional purpose and is intended as a generic way to compartmentalize your page structure.
- **Span:** `<span>` is used to distinguish a span of text. This tag also has no visual distinction, and is usually used alongside CSS to modify the style of a section of text.

## Form
Forms are essential for interacting with websites, allowing users to submit data for actions such as registration, feedback, or searches. A form begins with the `<form>` element, which houses the various input elements. The form also typically includes a method attribute, which determines how the data will be sent:

- **GET:** Submits data to retrieve information without modifying the website (e.g., search queries). If no method is specified, **GET** is the default.
- **POST:** Submits data that affects the website's backend, such as registering a new account or submitting a comment.

### Form Input Elements
Form inputs are elements that collect user information, such as text fields, checkboxes, date pickers, or dropdown menus. To ensure usability, each input should have an associated label, which indicates its purpose.
- **Labels:** Provide context for input fields and can be declared either as a parent to the input (nested structure) or separately using the for attribute.
- **Association via for and id:** The label element’s for attribute should match the id of the associated input. Each id must be unique within the page.
- **Input name attribute:** Represents the property name of the submitted data and should align with the backend logic. It’s often consistent with the id for clarity.

## Form Validation
HTML input validation ensures that user-submitted data meets specific criteria before being sent to the server. Validation can be implemented using attributes such as:
- **required:** Ensures the field is filled.
- **maxlength / minlength:** Limits the length of text input.
- **type:** Specifies the input format (e.g., email, number).
- **min / max:** Sets numerical or date ranges.
- **pattern:** Validates input using a regular expression.


## DOM
The DOM, or Document Object Model, is a data structure that represents the structure of an HTML document. It’s a hierarchical model that organizes the elements of a webpage like a tree. Each element in the HTML code, such as `<div>`, `<p>`, or `<h1>`, is represented as a node in the DOM tree. These nodes are connected in a parent-child relationship, where one element can contain other elements.

When a browser loads a webpage, it creates the DOM from the HTML code, turning each tag into a node. Each node has properties, such as its attributes and content, and can be manipulated with JavaScript to change the page dynamically.

Though you’ll primarily interact with the DOM when you work with JavaScript, it’s important to understand that the DOM is what the browser uses to interpret and display your HTML, and it can differ from the original HTML file.
